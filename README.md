# Water-Quality-Prediction
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of water based on various physical and chemical features. The goal is to help assess whether a water sample is safe for human consumption or needs treatment.

## Technologies Uses

  - Python
  - Numpy, pandas - Data Handling
  - Scikit-learn - Machine Learning Model
  - Matplotlib - Data Visualization

## Overview
  - Week1: Importing all the necessary libraries, loading the Dataset, Data Manipulation.
  - Week2: Handling the missing values in the data, training and testing the dataset and Built a Machine learning model using MultiOutputRegressor and RandomForestRegressor.
  - Week3: Writing a Python Script file (my_app.py) using Streamlit for user-fiendly interface.
  - Week4: Creating a Presentation on the project and submitting the Presentation

## Improvisation
  - I Developed a scoring system to classify water quality into categories like Good, Moderate, and Poor based on prediction outputs.
  - Why it is useful?
    Machine Learning gives us Numerical Pollutant Values, Users don't understand those easily. With the help of scoring Users can easily understand the Quality of Water(Good, Moderate, Poor.
